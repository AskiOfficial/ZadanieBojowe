    Java Variables
    Variables are containers for storing data values.

    In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

    String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
    int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

    Declaring (Creating) Variables
    To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
    <div class="codeBlock">
        type variableName = value;
    </div>
    Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

    To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:
</body>
</html>
